                    <p class="fs-6 lh-lg">
                        Florence Marguerite Knoll Bassett (1917–2019) was a visionary American architect, interior designer, and entrepreneur who fundamentally reshaped the modern interior and transformed the landscape of corporate America. A <mark>trailblazer</mark> in a male-dominated field, Knoll’s work seamlessly combined aesthetics and function, establishing a new standard for interior planning and workplace design.

                    <p class="fs-6 lh-lg">
                        In 1943, Florence joined Hans Knoll’s furniture company and soon became a full partner. Together, they formed Knoll Associates, which would become one of the most influential design firms of the 20th century. After Hans's untimely death in 1955, Florence took over as president, steering the company with clarity and vision. Her leadership helped cement Knoll's identity as a <mark>pioneer of modernist design</mark>, bringing European modernism to the American market.
                    </p>

                    <p class="fs-6 lh-lg"> A trained architect with a meticulous eye for detail, Knoll introduced the concept of the “total design” approach—an innovative method that integrated architecture, furniture, textiles, and space planning into a unified whole. Through her Planning Unit at Knoll, she reimagined the American office as an organized, efficient, and elegant environment. Her layouts emphasized clean lines, functional flow, and thoughtful use of space, influencing corporate interiors for decades to come. Many of her own furniture designs, created to fill in gaps where none existed, have since become enduring icons of modern design. </p>

                    <p class="fs-6 lh-lg"> Though she often downplayed her own furniture pieces as “fill-ins,” created to support her larger interior plans, Florence Knoll’s designs have become enduring icons of mid-century modernism. Pieces like the Florence Knoll sofa, credenza, and lounge chair are celebrated for their refined proportions, architectural clarity, and timeless appeal. Her designs exemplified her belief that furniture should not only be beautiful but also serve a clear function within a thoughtfully organized space. </p> 
                    <p class="fs-6 lh-lg"> In recognition of her vast contributions, Florence Knoll received numerous honors, including the prestigious <mark>National Medal of Arts in 2002.</mark> Today, her legacy lives on in both the timeless pieces she created and the design philosophies she championed. Her commitment to clarity, purpose, and elegance continues to shape the way designers, architects, and companies think about interior space. </p>
